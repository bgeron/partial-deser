# deser-incomplete

## Deserialize incomplete or broken data with Serde

Wrap Serde `Deserializer`s (like serde_json and serde_yaml) so you
can parse incomplete or tolerate broken data.

Streaming JSON for instance is technically invalid until the stream is done.
But by tolerating premature end of input, we can do something useful while
the stream is in progress.

Here, we printed the Rust debug representation. We also reserialized to JSON and
let nushell do its beautiful table formatting.

The JSON can also come from an external program. Here is a demo program that
computes disk usage of directories and outputs the results as JSON.
In true Unix style,  displaying for the user is a separate concern,
implemented by a separate program.

two programs is shown. The source program computes the disk size
of a bunch of directories and outputs a JSON array of objects. The sink program
pretty-prints the JSON table. Computing the disk size takes a while, and you can

while it is computing.' title='Demo that shows parsing JSON as it is generated live from another program that mimics du'

`deser-incomplete` sits between `#[serde(Deserialize)]` and the data format, and
safely halts parsing on parse errors or other errors.

### How to use

- JSON: call `from_json_str`.

- YAML: call `from_yaml_str`.

- Command line: `cargo install deser-incomplete --example repair-deser`, then pipe broken data
  through `repair-deser`. By default, it inputs and outputs JSON.

Other data formats work too:

- You need to explain how to create the `Deserializer` by implementing `Source`.

  - If your format has `&mut T: Deserializer` then mimic `source::JsonStr`.
  - If your format has `T: Deserializer` then mimic `source::YamlStr`.

- Some formats need a trailer for best results. For example, `from_json_str` appends
  a double-quote to the input before parsing, this lets `serde_json` strings that weren't
  actually complete.

  We also preprocess the input in `from_yaml_str`, actually there it is even more important
  for good results.

  _Add preprocessing with `Options::set_random_trailer`, or turn it off such preprocessing
  with `Options::disable_random_tag`. You can see the effect of it with
  `cargo run --example live -- --use-random-trailer false`._

  I expect that binary formats don't need this preprocessing.


### How this works internally

The implementation sits in between `Deserialize`, `Deserializer`, and `Visitor`,
gathers metadata during the parse, and saves successful sub-parses. It also "backtracks":
if a parse fails, then we retry, but just before the failure point we swap out the real
`Deserializer` for a decoy which can brings deserialization to a safe end.


We apply multiple techniques. Suppose we want to parse `Vec<u32>` with `serde_json`.
Here are the main techniques.

1. **(Example: parse empty JSON as `[]` .)** — On the top level, if parsing fails immediately (e.g.
   empty input) but a sequence is expected, then return `[]`.

   _\[setting name: fallback_seq_empty_at_root]_

2. **(Example: parse JSON `"[3"` as `[3]` .)** — When there are no more elements in a sequence,
   let the `Visitor` construct the `Vec<u32>` and put it somewhere safe. Now
   `serde_json::Deserializer::deserialize_seq` notices the missing close bracket and
   returns `Err` to us. We ignore `Err`, retrieve the saved value again, and return `Ok`
   of it.

   This happens for every `deserialize_*` method, not just sequences.

   _\[setting name: tolerate_deserializer_fail_after_visit_success]_

3. **(Example: parse JSON `"[3,"` as `[3]` .)** — Inside a sequence, if parsing the next element will
   fail, then don't even try.

   This works using backtracking.

   _\[setting name: backtrack_seq_skip_item]_

4. Before deserializing, we append a random trailer:


##### Random trailer

Additionally we have a "random trailer" technique to get incomplete strings to parse.
Unfortunately this technique is specific to the data format. This library implements
it for JSON and YAML.

This technique is not applied by default for other data formats. Even with JSON/YAML, this
technique can be turned off with `Options::disable_random_tag`.

##### Random trailer for JSON

We actually [append][append-impl] `tRANDOM"` to every JSON input, where `RANDOM` are some randomly chosen
letters. It turns out that `serde_json` can parse any prefix of valid JSON, as long
as we concatenate `tRANDOM"` to it. Some examples:

1. **(Example: `"hello` .)** The concatenation is `"hellotRANDOM"` and we actually get
    this back from `serde_json` through `fn visit_borrowed_str` --- after `serde_json`
    removed the double-quotes.

    In `fn visit_borrowed_str`, we notice that the string ends in `RANDOM`. Because this
    is a random string of letters, it cannot have been part of the incomplete JSON input.
    We remove the `tRANDOM` suffix and get back just `"hello"`.

2. **(Example: `"hello\` --- perhaps breaking in the middle of `\n` .)** The concatenation
    is `"hello\tRANDOM"`; the `\t` parses to a tab character. We strip off `<TAB>random`
    and again return `"hello"`.

3. **(Example: `"hello"` .)** The concatenation is `"hello"tRANDOM"`. Now `serde_json`
    visits the `hello` string as it would normally do, and if there should be any error
    after the visit, we can recover from it anyway as
    per _tolerate_deserializer_fail_after_visit_success_.

##### Inspecting at runtime

There is extensive logging through the `tracing` library, which becomes visible if you
initialize the library.

##### Guiding principles

The logic was hand-tweaked to the following criteria:

1. ("soundness") For any complete and valid JSON/YAML, if you call `deser-incomplete`
   on a prefix, then its output should not contain data that doesn't exist in the
   complete JSON/YAML.

2. ("monotone") A larger prefix should not parse to a shorter output.

3. ("prompt") Ideally, each prefix contains as much data as we can be certain of.

The implementation of `Deserializer` (data format) may influence the quality of the output,
but the default ruleset does generally very well with `serde_json` and `serde_yaml`.

There are [extensive snapshot tests][snapshot-tests] that validate the quality of the output
on these criteria.

If you are curious, then it is possible to tweak the ruleset
with `unstable::UnstableCustomBehavior`. We also have snapshot tests for some alternative
parsing configurations.

### Notes and limitations

- Ideally, your data format should be relatively greedy, in the sense that it
  generates information quickly and does not need to look ahead in the serialized
  stream too much.

- This approach lets us safely abort parsing and get a value, but
  we cannot skip over invalid segments of input. (For that you need
  an approach like [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/).)

- We cannot distinguish eof from invalid input.

- YAML works well in general, but it is a bit less exhaustively tested than JSON.
  The randomized trailer is really important for YAML.

- JSON: when parsing a floating-point number, if the end of input happens to fall
  directly after the decimal point, then the number is missing from the output.

- For YAML, the randomized trailer uses a heuristic to see if we are currently in
  an escape sequence in a string --- but this heuristic can fail. In this case,
  the incomplete string will be missing from the output.
